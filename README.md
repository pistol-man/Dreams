○ Selected Domain (e.g., Healthcare, Blockchain, Women Safety, etc.): Women Safety
○ Chosen Problem Statement: WS-02 - The 181 Women’s Helpline receives thousands of distress calls in megacities, but the spatial patterns and safety insights within this data remain underutilized. Currently, there is no geospatial system in place to identify high-risk zones or support proactive planning for women's safety in urban environments. This lack of data visualization limits effective resource deployment and policy-making.
